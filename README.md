## Data-Preprocessing-for-ML

# Project Overview
- This project aims to effectively manage missing data, ensuring that proper data filling and analysis steps are taken. The goal is to deliver and visualize the data accurately before applying machine learning (ML) algorithms.

# Key Objectives
1. Handle Missing Data: Implement robust techniques to fill missing data points.
2. Data Analysis: Perform thorough data analysis to understand and clean the dataset.
3. Data Visualization: Create visual representations of the data to highlight patterns and insights.
4. Machine Learning Preparation: Ensure the data is preprocessed and ready for ML algorithms.

git clone https://github.com/nicolasKappa/Data-Preprocessing-and-Analysis.git

2. Install Anaconda-Navigator
- Open the terminal, copy "conda install anaconda-navigator", paste in terminal and press enter.

3. Open Jupyter Notebook 
- Open Notebook from anaconda-navigator and upload Data Preprocessing and Analysis Code.ipynb



# Tasks 
- Performed detailed analysis of data quality for the dataset provided.
- Map out, in outline form, what data cleansing measures would need to be put in place to prepare the dataset for ML work.
- Indicate the types of Pandas-Scikit-Learn python commands that could be used whilst carrying out the measures you suggested in task 2.
- Attempt a clean-up of the dataset using the procedures set out in (2) and (3) and report on the degree of success with carrying this out.
